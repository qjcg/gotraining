## Web - TLS

Learn about securing your application using TLS.

## Notes

* Usually apps just listen for HTTP and offload TLS termination to a load balancer like Caddy or Nginx.
* The net/http package provides support for TLS if you really need it
* The crypto/tls package comes with a program for generating self signed certificates

    go run /usr/local/go/src/crypto/tls/generate_cert.go --host localhost
